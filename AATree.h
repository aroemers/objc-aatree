 *
 * This is an implementation of the Arne Andersson Tree, which is a balanced binary search
 * tree. For more information on how the balancing, inserting and deletion algorithms 
 * work, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andersson_tree
 *
 * This class is set-up as an extension of the NSMutableDictionary class cluster, so all 
 * of the methods in the NSMutableDictionary public abstract interface can be called on this 
 * class also, with the exception of the initialize methods. The class supports the 
 * NSCopying and NSFastEnumeration protocols, among others.
 *
 * The class has been suitable for any type of data, and more importantly, for any type
 * of key. When initializing the tree, one must supply a NSComparator block which contains
 * the logic to compare two keys. Do note that a copy of the key is created when inserted
 * into the tree, so it must implement the NSCopying protocol.
 *
 * One of the advantages of using a tree as data model, is it is easy to determine an
 * object closest to a key. This is why the method objectClosestToKey is included in the
 * interface.
 *
 * The tree is completely thread safe. It uses a readers/write lock pattern, so multiple
 * readers (threads) don't lock each other out. The only time the readers do get locked is
 * when a writer (thread) wants or has access to the tree for mutations. In short, the
 * accessors can be used in parallel, but will have to wait for possible mutations to finish. 
 * This thread safety pattern is very suitable for a tree like this and, compared to 
 * the other locking mechanisms in Objective-C, the fastest when the tree is accessed
 * more often that mutated.
 * 
 * This class may be used, modified and distributed freely. Of course I would like to hear
 * about any updates, requests or bugs. I can be contacted at a.roemers@gmail.com
